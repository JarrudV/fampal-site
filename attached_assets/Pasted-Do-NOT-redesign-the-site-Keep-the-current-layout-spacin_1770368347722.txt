Do NOT redesign the site. Keep the current layout, spacing, colours, typography, components, and overall aesthetic.

This is a copy and content alignment pass so the site matches FamPal’s real superpower: removing the pain of choosing family friendly places by showing practical facilities info and real world advice, then helping families plan together and save what worked.

Hero updates
- Replace the H1 with:
  Less searching.
  Less guessing.
  Plan family adventures with ease.
- Update the hero subhead to explicitly mention the practical details parents care about:
  play areas, pram access, toilets, parking, shade, noise, etc
  and that FamPal reduces Googling and calling.
- Keep the primary CTA as “Open the app” linking to https://app.fampal.co.za
- Change the secondary CTA to “How it works” (scrolls to the How it works section)

Add a short pain section directly under the hero (must match the existing design language)
Section title: “Sound familiar?”
Bullets (use these exact ideas, keep tone human and slightly cheeky but not rude):
- “We need to do something with the kids… now what?”
- “Does this place actually have a play area?”
- “Is it pram friendly or am I carrying everything?”
- “Where do we park?”
- “Is it genuinely kid friendly or just says it is?”
- “Why am I phoning places like it’s 2009?”
Then a short line: “FamPal fixes this.”

Features section updates (rename and reorder cards, keep same card UI)
Refocus features from privacy first to decision relief first.
Use this order and headings:
1 Know before you go
   Show the facilities that matter: play areas, toilets, pram access, parking, shade.
2 Real world family advice
   AI summarises reviews to highlight family friendliness so you don’t read 200 reviews.
3 Plan together
   Share options with your partner or circle and decide once.
4 Save the easy wins
   Save favourites so next weekend is a one tap decision.
5 Private by default
   Memories and plans are only visible to people you choose.
6 Built on trusted tech
   Google Maps, Gemini AI, secure cloud.

How it works section updates (keep same layout)
Title: “How FamPal works”
Subtitle: “Three simple steps to easier family plans.”
Steps:
1 Pick a vibe
2 Check what matters
3 Share, go, remember

Phone mockup carousel/screens
Do not redesign the phone component.
Update the screens shown so they visually support the new messaging:
- One screen must clearly show facility chips (play area, toilets, pram friendly, parking).
- One screen must show an AI review summary style card focused on families.
- One screen must show save/favourite and share to a circle.
If real screenshots exist, use them. If not, create high quality in-brand mock screens (not generic templates).

Pricing
Pricing is not final.
Keep the pricing page/section but add a small note: “Final pricing will be confirmed at launch. Early users get founder perks.”
Do not change the pricing amounts yet.

Do not change
- Overall layout
- Colour palette
- Button styles
- Header/footer structure

After completing changes
- Run build and ensure no errors
- Summarise the exact files changed
