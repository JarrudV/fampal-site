Create a public “Delete Account / Data Deletion” page on the main website (www.fampal.co.za).

Context
- FamPal main marketing website: https://www.fampal.co.za
- The web app portal is hosted at: https://app.fampal.co.za
- Users can already delete their account inside the app, but Google Play requires a public website link explaining how to delete an account and what data is deleted.
- The website page must be publicly accessible (no login required) and suitable to paste into Google Play Console as the “Delete account URL”.

What to build
1) Add a new route/page on www.fampal.co.za:
   - URL: /delete-account (preferred)
   - Also accept /account-deletion as an alias redirect if easy
2) The page must clearly explain:
   - How to delete the account inside the app (step-by-step)
   - What data is deleted when deleting the account
   - What data may be retained and why (legal/security) and for how long if applicable
   - How users can contact support if they cannot access the app
3) Add a “Manage my data” section with two options:
   A) Delete my full account (redirects to app flow)
   B) Delete some data only (without deleting the account)

Partial data deletion requirements
- Provide a simple UI on the website page that lets a logged-in user request deletion of specific categories:
  - Saved places / favourites
  - Search history (if stored)
  - Reviews and notes (if supported; warn this removes their contribution)
  - Partner links / circle membership (if applicable)
  - Profile preferences (dietary/accessibility/interests)
- If the user is not logged in on the app portal, show a “Log in to manage data” button that takes them to https://app.fampal.co.za/login (or the correct login route).
- Once logged in, show the data deletion options and allow the user to submit the request.
- The deletion should require confirmation (checkbox + confirm button), and show a success message.

Implementation guidance (choose the simplest that fits existing stack)
- If the website is a static marketing site and does not share auth with the app, keep the website page as informational only + a “Go to app to manage deletion” button.
- If the website can integrate with the app auth (preferred), implement partial deletion actions by calling an existing API/Cloud Function endpoint, or create a new endpoint:
  - POST /api/user/delete-data
  - body: { categories: string[] }
  - auth required
  - server deletes selected data in Firestore for that user
- Do NOT expose admin credentials.
- Do NOT allow deleting other users’ data.
- Log deletion requests server-side with timestamp and categories for audit.

Copy to include on the page (use this wording, adjust only for accuracy)
- Title: “Delete your FamPal account or data”
- Short intro: “You can permanently delete your account, or delete specific data without removing your account.”
- Section 1: “Delete your account in the app” with steps:
  1) Open the FamPal app (app.fampal.co.za)
  2) Go to Profile
  3) Select Delete Account
  4) Type DELETE to confirm
  5) Confirm deletion
- Section 2: “What gets deleted” list:
  - User profile and sign-in access
  - Saved places and favourites
  - Reviews/notes you created (if applicable)
  - Partner/circle links and shared spaces tied to your account
  - Smart Insights usage history and preferences
- Section 3: “What may be retained” (minimal):
  - Limited data for legal compliance, fraud prevention, and security auditing
  - If any retention period exists, state it; otherwise say “only as required by law”
- Section 4: “Delete some data only” with login CTA + category checkboxes + confirm flow
- Support: support@fampal.co.za (or use the correct email if different)

Deliverables
- New page/route added to www.fampal.co.za at /delete-account
- Buttons linking to app portal for login and in-app deletion flow
- Partial data deletion flow implemented if feasible with current auth/API; otherwise implement the UI and redirect to the app with a message “Log in to manage data deletion”
- Ensure the page is public, mobile-friendly, and clear enough for Google Play review.
